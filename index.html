            <h3>2024 Timeline</h3>
            <p>To my dearest friend, <br>

              I want to take a moment to show you just how much I love and appreciate everything you are and everything youâ€™ve been to me. Youâ€™ve been a constant in my life, and I canâ€™t imagine this year without you. Even though we didnâ€™t talk from March to November, my love for you has never wavered. Christmas came and went, but I never forgot you. This is me officially telling you how much you mean to me, no matter the distance or silence.
              
              As 2024 comes to a close, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for having you by my side, and as we look ahead to 2025, I canâ€™t help but feel even more excited for the adventures and memories that are yet to come. Iâ€™m happy, truly happy, for the gift of your friendship. Thank you for being such a bright light in my life. May this new year bring you endless joy, peace, and everything your heart desires.
              
              I havenâ€™t called because I know how busy you are, and I donâ€™t want to add more to your plate. I know you would answer if I called, but I chose not to, because I care about your well-being. I want you to have time for yourself, to rest, and not feel like you need to stay up late on the phone with me. I love and appreciate those moments, but this time, I want to make it about YOU.
              
              Thank you for everything you do, and for just being you. I hope you feel loved and appreciated, and reminded of the bond we share. Hereâ€™s to an amazing year aheadâ€”may all your dreams come true, and may every step you take bring you closer to the happiness you deserve.
              
              With all my heart,
              Happy New Year, my dear friend! Whether you see this now or later, I wish you all the best in 2025 and beyond.</p>
